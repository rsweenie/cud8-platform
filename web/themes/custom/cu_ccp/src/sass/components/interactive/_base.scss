    INTERACTIVE COMPONENTS

    Each interactive component should have it's own file, along with the base file
    for each interactive component, we should have alteration files for each version.

    ANIMATIONS.CSS

    This library can be used to add simple animations to things, it should 
    only be included if animations are going to be used to enhance the website 
    because this file adds a substantial amount of weight to the file size.

    Go into the _animations.scss file and remove any animations that aren't going
    to be used on the website so that the final CSS file's output is reduced to only 
    what is necessary.

    Animations.css is good to use with Owl Carousel to alter the animation effects
    of the slide transitions. Examples of this in action can be seen on 
    interactive/carousels.html .

    We also use animations.css to control the animated loading of content. Examples 
    of all the animations available are located in interactive/animations.html.

    EFFECTS LIBRARY

    This library can be used to add simple interactive effects to components found
    throughout the Component Library.

    These are meant to show what we can do, and be a solid starting point. They may
    require some additional work to get things to work completely as expected.
